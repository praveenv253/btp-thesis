\noindent This report outlines the theory behind, the working of, and the
design decisions that went into the creation of an OFDM stack and a few other
modules that were constructed primarily as component blocks of a larger
project aimed at implementing and demonstrating a real-time Dirty Paper Coding
framework in a base-station-with-two-users environment. The report aims to be
used as a reference design document for future generations of this framework.
