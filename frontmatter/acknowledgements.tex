I'd sincerely like to thank my guide, Prof.\ Radhakrishna Ganti, for always
being there whenever I had a problem. I don't think I could have asked for
anything more in a guide, considering how he's physically sat alongside me,
reading obscure code and helping me figure out the problems.

Second, I'd like to thank Arjun for helping me through this entire journey. He,
too, has always been there when I needed someone to bounce ideas off, to check
my code, or otherwise help me figure out some problem.

I'd like to thank Prof.\ HSR for giving me some useful advice when I needed it,
and for being supportive when I chose to make the switch to Comm. I'd also like
to thank the other members of my lab, for making it a pleasant (if, at times,
somewhat PJ-filled) working environment.

Last, but not the least, I'd like to thank my family for giving me the freedom
to choose anyhow I wished, and for being fully supportive of any decision I
took.
